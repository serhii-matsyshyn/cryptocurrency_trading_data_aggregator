## ðŸ–¥ Usage

### Requirements
- Docker
- Docker-compose
- Python 3.10 or higher
- Pip

It is necessary to install the required Python packages on the host machine (for easy deployment):
```shell
pip3 install -r infrastructure_services/requirements.txt
```

### infrastructure_services
```shell
cd infrastructure_services
./start-infrastructure-services.sh
```

### Docker compose run all services
It is possible to use the following command to run all services, but it may cause docker-compose and build merge issues:
```shell
sudo docker-compose -f ws_live_data_retrieve_service/docker-compose.yml \
                    -f sheduled_report_compute_service/docker-compose.yml \
                    -f precomputed_report_data_retrieve_service/docker-compose.yml \
                    -f live_data_retrieve_service/docker-compose.yml \
                    -f facade_service/docker-compose.yml \
up
```

For an easy debug, you can run each service separately (it is recommended to use this method):
```shell
sudo docker-compose -f ws_live_data_retrieve_service/docker-compose.yml up -d
sudo docker-compose -f sheduled_report_compute_service/docker-compose.yml up -d
sudo docker-compose -f precomputed_report_data_retrieve_service/docker-compose.yml up -d
sudo docker-compose -f live_data_retrieve_service/docker-compose.yml up -d
sudo docker-compose -f facade_service/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

### To attach to logs of service:
```shell
sudo docker container logs -f ws-live-data-retrieve-service
```

### To stop all services:
```shell
sudo docker-compose -f ws_live_data_retrieve_service/docker-compose.yml down
sudo docker-compose -f sheduled_report_compute_service/docker-compose.yml down
sudo docker-compose -f precomputed_report_data_retrieve_service/docker-compose.yml down
sudo docker-compose -f live_data_retrieve_service/docker-compose.yml down
sudo docker-compose -f facade_service/docker-compose.yml down
sudo docker-compose -f infrastructure_services/docker-compose-infrastructure.yml down
```
### To rebuild all services:
```shell
sudo docker-compose -f ws_live_data_retrieve_service/docker-compose.yml build --no-cache
sudo docker-compose -f sheduled_report_compute_service/docker-compose.yml build --no-cache
sudo docker-compose -f precomputed_report_data_retrieve_service/docker-compose.yml build --no-cache
sudo docker-compose -f live_data_retrieve_service/docker-compose.yml build --no-cache
sudo docker-compose -f facade_service/docker-compose.yml build --no-cache
```

## REST API
The following REST APIs are available:  

Part A: A set of REST APIs that will return the precomputed report data. The data for these reports would be prepared in advance with batch processing operations:
1. Return the aggregated statistics containing the number of transactions for each cryptocurrency for each hour in the last 6 hours, excluding the previous hour.
2. Return the statistics about the total trading volume for each cryptocurrency for the last 6 hours, excluding the previous hour.
3. Return aggregated statistics containing the number of trades and their total volume for each hour in the last 12 hours, excluding the current hour.

Part B: A set of REST APIs that will return the results of ad-hoc queries. User provides parameters to the API and it should respond according to the specified values:
1. Return the number of trades processed in a specific cryptocurrency in the last N minutes, excluding the last minute.
2. Return the top N cryptocurrencies with the highest trading volume in the last hour.
3. Return the cryptocurrencyâ€™s current price for Â«BuyÂ» and Â«SellÂ» sides based on its symbol.

### Information on volume type
The reason for having separate endpoints params (`foreignNotional`, `homeNotional`) is Bitmex's unique method of reporting trading volume. Bitmex doesn't provide a unified volume value in a fixed currency like USD (or BTC); instead, it offers volume data in various forms such as home, foreign, or relative points based on the specific cryptocurrency pairs being traded.

Sorting by volume can present challenges in interpretation. For instance, if using `volume` value (that is, relative points) or `homeNotional`, cryptocurrencies like PEPE with a high number of digits may appear to have a higher volume than BTC, despite BTC being a more widely traded asset. This discrepancy arises due to the differing digit counts in their respective representations (and mixed `volume` representation across pairs).

Using `foreignNotional` as the volume type offers a more stable calculation. This is because most cryptocurrencies on Bitmex are paired with USD-based assets like USD, USDT, or USDC. However, there are exceptions such as BTCETH pairs, which can introduce some complexity.

Unfortunately, it's impractical to split pairs or calculate a relative volume value due to the limitations of Bitmex's data reporting. As a result, separate endpoints params are necessary to provide clarity on trading volume metrics based on different volume types, and still, there are several pairs that will be incorrectly sorted, if their `foreignNotional` is not USD-based.
